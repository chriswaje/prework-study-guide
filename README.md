# Chris' Pre-work Study Guide

## Description

The motivation for building this project was to both learn the basics of coding (HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript) and help future students enrolled in the bootcamp with building their own prework study guide. This project separates notes based on each coding language in order to learn and study each language in an organized manner. Throughout the course of this guide, users will be able to utilize the notes as they progress through the prework assigned before starting bootcamp.
