          <li>HyperText Markup language (HTML) gives our content <strong>structure</strong>.</li>
          <li>It is made up of elements which work together to provide content and the basic framework for all pages on the web</li>
          <li>An <strong>element</strong> is a type of content on a webpage (i.e. text, image, header, list, etc.)</li>
          <li>Common element types are used to divide and describe a page
            <ul><!--start of subnote-->
                <li>Meta-related elements, content division elements, and semantic elements</li>
            </ul><!--end of subnote-->
          </li>
          <li>Building a sturdy fram using HTML is the first thing to think about when developing a webpage</li>
          <li>HTML elements are usually composed of an opening tag and a closing represented with angle brackets (&lt&gt)
            <ul><!--start of subnote-->
              <li>Two especially important ones are the &lthead&gt and &ltbody&gt elements</li>
            </ul><!--end of subnote-->
          </li>
          <li><strong>&lthead&gt</strong> element contains information, or metadata, that helps the browser to render the page correctly
            <ul><!--start of subnote-->
              <li>Elements includeed within this are not visible when a user looks at a webpage</li>
            </ul><!--end of subnote-->
            </li>
            <li><strong>&ltbody&gt</strong> element contains the content that is shown to the user.
            <ul><!--start of subnote-->
              <li>All the elements that we want the user to see and interact with must be placed inside this element</li>
            </ul><!--end of subnote-->
            </li>
            <li><strong>&lt!DOCTYPE html&gt</strong> is a declaration telling the browser what document type it should expect when it is opened; 
              it is letting the browser know to expect HTML on the page</li>
              <li>Declarations are not case-sensitive but HTML elements are</li>
              <li><strong>&lthtml&gt</strong> tag represents the root of our HTML document
                <ul><!--start of subnote-->
                  <li>Inside the tag is an attribute of <strong>lang="en"</strong> which tells the browser the language for the webpage</li>

                </li>
              <li><strong>HTML attribute</strong> defines additional information about an element
                <ul><!--start of subnote-->
                  <li>These are always defined in the beginning element, never the closing element </li>
                </ul><!--end of subnote-->
              </li>
              <li><strong>Metdata</strong> is data about our webpage that the browser uses to effectively serve our webpage to users. This contains 
                  important information about accessibility, search engines, and performance</li>
              <li>The following  metadata tags can be found inside the <strong>&lthead&gt</strong> element
                <ul><!--start of nested list-->
                  <li><strong>&lttitle&gt</strong> element defines the title for a webpage. This is required and is extremely important for Search engines
                      optimization (SEO)</li>
                  <li><strong>&ltstyle&gt</strong> element defines the CSS style associated with a website</li>
                  <li><strong>&ltbase&gt</strong> element defines the base URL for a webpage</li>
                  <li><strong>&ltlink&gt</strong> element connects an external resource to the HTML document</li>
                  <li><strong>&ltmeta&gt</strong> element defines metadata such as the character set, description, keywords, author, and viewport</li>

              </li>
              <li><strong>&lt/head&gt</strong> and <strong>&lt/body&gt</strong> are considered closing tags; the / before "head" and "body" indicates closing</li>
              <li><strong>Charset</strong> element sets our character encoding</li>
              <li><strong>Http-equiv</strong> element sets an HTTP header for content</li>
              <li><strong>Viewport</strong> element sets the default view for our webpage</li>
              <li><strong>Child elements</strong> are elements that are nested inside other elements
                <ul><!--start of subnote-->
                  <li><strong>&lthead&gt</strong> and <strong>&ltbody&gt</strong> would be considered <strong>parent elements</strong> while the elements inside them

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul><!--start of CSS notes-->
          <li>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) gives the content <strong>style</strong></li>
          <li>It is a programming language used by developers to define how webpage content is presented to users (defines colors, aesthetics, visual layout, and organization)</li>
          <li>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS: <strong>inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet,</strong> and <strong>external CSS style sheet</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Inline CSS</strong> applies to a specific HTML tag, using a style attribute with a CSS rule to style a particular page lement only; these are quick and 
              permanent changes but are less flexible than external and internal style sheets</li>
          <li><strong>Internal CSS style sheet</strong> contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file</li>
          <li><strong>External CSS style sheet</strong> (most common way to style a webpage) allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design
              changes easier</li>
          <li><strong>Selector</strong> defines the element or attributes to which the rules, or declaration, will apply</li>
          <li><strong>Declarations</strong> contain two improtant components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property</li>
          <li><strong>Margin</strong> property indicates how much space we want around the <strong>outside</strong> of an element. This is not visible on the page</li>
          <li><strong>Padding</strong> property adds space around the content <strong>inside</strong> an element</li>
          <li>We use a special symbol <strong>* (asterisk)</strong> when we want to apply a rule to all the elements visible on the page</li>
          <li>Two or more elements that will share the same styling can be grouped together using a comma</li>
          <li><strong>rel</strong> attribute specifies the relationship between the current document and the linked document resource</li>
          <li> <strong>Class attributes</strong> allow us to share a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class selector
            <ul><!--start of subnote-->
                <li>We use a period preceding <strong>card</strong> to designate this as a class selector; therefore, any HTML element assigned to the class "card" will
                    gain the property from the CSS</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul><!--start of JavaScript notes-->
          <li>JavaScript handles the <strong>logic</strong> and <strong>interactivity</strong> of a website</li>
          <li>It is a high-level dynamic programming language that allows users to interact with websites
            <ul><!--start of subnote-->
              <li>You can power websites with effects, interactivity, data communication, and much more!</li>
            </ul><!--end of subnote-->
          </li>
          <li>In JavaScript, the code to be executed is written inside <strong>curly brackets {}</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Variable</strong> is a named container that allows us to  store data in our code</li>
          <li>We use the <strong>var</strong> keyword to delcare a variable then give the variable a name 
              (must be unique because it is how we will reference the information stored in the varaible in our code)</li>
          <li> We use an assignment operator <strong>= (equal sign)</strong> to assign the specific data that we want stored in our variable</li>
          <li>It is important to note that each line of JavaScript code ends with a semicolon</li>
          <li><strong>String</strong> a sequence of text that is always enclosed within quotation marks</li>
          <li>We can use the <strong>console.log</strong> method to output a message to the web console by adding an argument</li>
          <li>Arguments are bits of data that variables/methods use to do their job</li>
          <li><strong>Method</strong> is a set of instructions that can be executed by a computer</li>
          <li>The <strong>.log()</strong> method will output whatever we add inside the parentheses to the console</li>
          <li><strong>Control flow</strong> is the order in which a computer executes code in a script
            <ul><!--start of subnote-->
              <li>The computer reads code in a linear fashion, so the order in which we write our code is very important!</li>
              <li>Control flow can be interrupted; using conditional statements and loops can control the order in which code is executed 
                or even executed at all</li>
            </ul><!--end of subnote-->
          </li>
          <li><strong>Conditionals</strong> are code structures used to test if an expression returns true or not. A very common form of Conditionals
              is the <strong>if...else</strong> statement</li>
          <li><strong>"If" statements</strong> are a way of introducing decision-making into our code
            <ul><!--start of nested list-->
              <li>Code will only execute if the statement meets a condition or is true; otherwise, it will ignore whatever is in between the curly
                brackets and move on</li>
              <li>A false value will be expressed as one of the following: 0, -0, On, "", null, undefined, NaN, or a Boolean data type with value false</li>
              <li>We can have more than one condition in JavaScript by using <strong>else if</strong></li>
            </ul><!--end of nested list-->
          </li>
          <li><strong>Array</strong> is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data (can be single or multiple data types)
            <ul><!--start of subnote-->
              <li>Typically used to hold data that is related in some way</li>
            </ul><!--end of subnote-->

          <li><strong>Index</strong> is a unique number used to identify the location of the data item in the array
            <ul><!--start of subnote-->
              <li>Note that in JavaScript and many other programming languages, arrays are zero-indexed (i.e. starts with 0) and sequential</li>
            </ul><!--end of subnote-->
          </li>
          <li><strong>For loop</strong> uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code
          block to be executed over and over</li>
          <li>In order to use the <strong>for loop</strong>, we need the shape's index and the array's length
            <ul><!--start of nested list-->
              <li>The array length is important because the for loop needs to know how many times the code will run until there are no items left in the array</li>
              <li><strong>Length</strong> is a built-in property of an array that we can use to find the length of an array</li>
            </ul><!--end of nest list-->
          </li>
          <li>A <strong>for loop</strong> contains the following three important statements
            <ul><!--start of nested list-->
              <li>The first statement determines the <strong>starting point of our loop</strong></li>
              <li>The second statement is the <strong>condition</strong></li>
              <li>The final statement is what allows the array to iterate over each item
                <ul><!--start of subnote-->
                  <li>Since the indices follow a predictable pattern, we know the number increases by 1 each time. The code <strong>x++</strong> is a shortcut
                      way of writing x+1</li>

          <li><strong>Function</strong> is a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task
            <ul><!--start of subnote-->
              <li>Unlike for loops, <strong>functions</strong> do not automatically execute when the JavaScript file is run. You must call it by name in order to execute</li>
              <li><strong>Arguments</strong> are bits of data that functions use to do their job</li>
            </ul><!--end of subnote-->
          </li>
          <li>There are 2 requirements for a JavaScript function
            <ul><!--start of nested list-->
              <li>1. Define the function</li>
              <li>2. Call the function</li>
            </ul><!--end of nested list-->
          </li>
          <li>To create a <strong>function</strong> we use the <strong>function</strong> keyword, similar to how we used the <strong>var</strong> keyword to delcare
              a new variable. A function's name is followed by parentheses</li>
          <li>When we delcare a function in our JavaScript code, we are creating a reusable block of code that performs a specific task</li>
          <li>To randomize a selection from an array, we need to use a special <strong>Math</strong> function</li>
